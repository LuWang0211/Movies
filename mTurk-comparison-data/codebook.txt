This dataset contains all submitted surveys with the following exclusions and adjustments:

- records where the user failed to answer yes to the Y/N question "Can we use the answers you have just given for our research (and did you answer these questions accurately / as best you could)?"
- records with age < 18 were removed
- The character " was replaced with ” in all free response fields

The data was collected at two different sites with the same survey (see the file survey.html) and the responses from each are in the two different files:

data_amt.csv: Respondents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. They were paid $0.20 to participate and to qualify had to have completed at least 100 other HITs with a 97%+ acceptance rate.
data_ospp.csv: Respondents were recruited on a website offering free personality tests. They would have visited the website for recreational purposes. They received no compensation and the survey was open to all.
