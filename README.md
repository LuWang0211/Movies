https://github.com/zishuijingw/Movies/tree/master/img_folder/rating_over_year.png

With the development of the film industry, the number of movies has increased rapidly, and the number of corresponding comments has also increased. In the yearly film rating, the film score gap is also widening. However, the mean of the film scores did not change significantly.

  1. Focus on lead actors/actresses
  2. Filter the dataset to get age information

There is a gap between the ages of men and women, and the gap does not change over time. But both began to rise at the same time.

Q: Whether the age has an impact on movies ratings?

Mathematical calculation of linear correlationï¼š
actresses['averageRating'].corr(actresses['age']) = 0.037979784708851626
actors['averageRating'].corr(actors['age']) = -0.0019829741473593085

-> there is no linear relationship between the two variables
